  abstract = {This paper presents a new architecture that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) devices, service robots, and users in a smart assistive environment. A new intuitive and multimodal interaction system supporting people with disabilities and bedbound patients is presented. This interaction system allows the user to control service robots and devices inside the room in five different ways: touch control, eye control, gesture control, voice control, and augmented reality control. The interaction system is comprised of an assistive robotic arm holding a tablet PC. The robotic arm can place the tablet PC in front of the user. A demonstration of the developed technology, a prototype of a smart room equipped with home automation devices, and the robotic assistive arm are presented. The results obtained from the use of the various interfaces and technologies are presented in the article. The results include user preference with regard to eye-base control (performing clicks, and using winks or gaze) and the use of mobile phones over augmented reality glasses, among others.},

  abstract = {Background
  The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is challenging for both those affected as well as for their care providers, and caregivers. Socially assistive robots (SARs) offer promising supportive care to assist in the complex management associated with AD.
  Objectives
  To conduct a scoping review of published articles that proposed, discussed, developed or tested SAR for interacting with AD patients.
  Methods
  We performed a scoping review informed by the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist for reporting the results. At the identification stage, an information specialist performed a comprehensive search of 8 electronic databases from the date of inception until January 2022 in eight bibliographic databases. The inclusion criteria were all populations who recive or provide care for AD, all interventions using SAR for AD and our outcomes of inteerst were any outcome related to AD patients or care providers or caregivers. All study types published in the English language were included.
  Results
  After deduplication, 1251 articles were screened. Titles and abstracts screening resulted to 252 articles. Full-text review retained 125 included articles, with 72 focusing on daily life support, 46 on cognitive therapy, and 7 on cognitive assessment.
  Conclusion
  We conducted a comprehensive scoping review emphasizing on the interaction of SAR with AD patients, with a specific focus on daily life support, cognitive assessment, and cognitive therapy. We discussed our findings’ pertinence relative to specific populations, interventions, and outcomes of human-SAR interaction on users and identified current knowledge gaps in SARs for AD patients.}

  abstract = {Although the global population is aging, the proportion of potential caregivers is not keeping pace. It is necessary for society to adapt to this demographic change, and new technologies are a powerful resource for achieving this. New tools and devices can help to ease independent living and alleviate the workload of caregivers. Among them, socially assistive robots (SARs), which assist people with social interactions, are an interesting tool for caregivers thanks to their proactivity, autonomy, interaction capabilities, and adaptability. This article describes the different design and implementation phases of a SAR, the CLARA robot, both from a physical and software point of view, from 2016 to 2022. During this period, the design methodology evolved from traditional approaches based on technical feasibility to user-centered co-creative processes. The cognitive architecture of the robot, CORTEX, keeps its core idea of using an inner representation of the world to enable inter-procedural dialogue between perceptual, reactive, and deliberative modules. However, CORTEX also evolved by incorporating components that use non-functional properties to maximize efficiency through adaptability. The robot has been employed in several projects for different uses in hospitals and retirement homes. This paper describes the main outcomes of the functional and user experience evaluations of these experiments.},

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of a therapeutic robot, ‘Paro’, on anxiety, agitation, depression, apathy, medication use, total sleep time, and sociability among older adults with dementia.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis with narrative synthesis.
Setting and participants
Older adults aged 60 years and above with any form of dementia in the community, nursing homes, or care facilities.
Methods
A three-step search strategy was conducted by two independent reviewers. Nine databases were searched (January 2003 to November 2022). Randomised controlled, crossover, and cluster trials on Paro for older adults with dementia published in English were included. All relevant trials were screened and assessed for risk of bias. Data were extracted using the Cochrane data collection form. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the quality of evidence.
Results
In total, 12 articles involving 1461 participants were included. Results of the meta-analysis showed that Paro had a moderate effect on medication use (SMD: −0.63) and small effect on anxiety (SMD: −0.17), agitation (SMD: −0.27) and depression (SMD: −0.40). However, Paro exhibited negligible effect on total sleep time (SMD: −0.12). The overall quality of evidence for all outcomes were graded as low due to methodological limitations, small sample size, and wide confidence intervals. Narrative synthesis suggested that Paro reduced apathy and increase sociability.
Conclusion and implications
Paro could be a beneficial non-pharmacological approach to improve behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, reducing medication use, and increasing sociability for older adults with dementia. However, the results should be interpreted with caution as limited studies were available. Additionally, there were a variety of approaches across the studies (i.e. group and individual interventions, facilitated and non-facilitated) which made it difficult to determine which interventional approach is optimal to produce beneficial effects of Paro. Hence, more rigorous studies with a larger sample size are needed to fully understand the mechanism and effectiveness of Paro in older adults with dementia. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022296504).}
